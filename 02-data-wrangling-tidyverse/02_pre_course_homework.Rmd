# If new to R

- Look over previous workshop [slides](http://bit.ly/berd_r_intro) and [video](https://echo360.org/section/aefe4e1c-c635-4a3b-bf99-ce6439184f5f/public) (Februrary 26 "Getting Started with R and Rstudio"). Finish up any practice problems you did not complete during the previous workshop. The last page of the slides has a link to the practice problems answers.
- Read [this chapter in Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/2-getting-started.html#package-installation) to learn how to install packages and load packages.
