# Introduction

Rrrrrr?

# What is R? 

.pull-left[
- A programming language
- Focus on statistical modeling and data analysis
    + import data, maniupulate data, run statistics, make plots
- Useful for "Data Science"
- Great visualizations
- Also useful for most anything else you'd want to tell a computer to do
- Interfaces with other languages i.e. python, C++, bash

]

For the history and details: [Wikipedia](https://bit.ly/1efFmaY)

- an interpreted language (run it through a command line)
- proceduaral programming with functions
- Why "R"?? Scheme (?) inspired S (invented at Bell Labs in 1976) which inspired R (**free and open source!** in 1993)

# What is Rstudio?

![](img/01_md_rstudio.png)

- R is a programming language
- Rstudio is an integrated developement environment (IDE) = an interface to use R (with perks!)

from [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/2-getting-started.html); see also [DataCamp's video discussion on the difference](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=1)

# Start Rstudio

# Rstudio anatomy

---

# Show stuff

- tour of Rstudio
- use console
- run some code
- make an R file and save it
- add some code

---

# Practice on your own

- create a folder on your computer
- set your working directory in Rstudio to that folder
- make a new script and save it as `practice.R` in your folder

(Note: later using `Projects` will make this easier)

# Coding and Data Structures

We are real coders, now...

---

# Code

Type code in the console, or in an R script

```{r}
"hello"

3 + 5

# this is a comment
# nothing happens
# y = 5
```


---

# Variables

Data, information, everything is stored as a variable

```{r}
x = 5
x
x <- 5
x

y <- 1:5
y
```

---

# We can do math

```{r}
x <- 5
x

x + 3

y <- x^2
y

log2(y)
```



---

# Data

```{r}
head(iris)
```

```{r}
# Quickly make a plot
hist(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

---

# Installing and using packages

Also can use the "Packages" tab in the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer window

## CRAN = package mothership

[Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install a package from CRAN (main package repository)
install.packages("tidyverse")
# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
```

## Other places (i.e. github) = wild west

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
# Install a package from github (often in development, no testing)
# https://github.com/hadley/yrbss
install_github("hadley/yrbss")
library(yrbss)
```


---

# Load a data set

Built in datasets like `iris`

```{r}
# head function shows the top 6 rows
head(iris)
```

From a file

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata <- read_csv("data.csv")
mydata <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/berd_data_csv")
```
