# Introduction 

## Questions

- Who has used R?
- Why do you want to learn R?

---

# Learning Objectives

- Basic operations in R/Rstudio
- Understand data structures
- Be able to load in data
- Basic operations on data
- Be able to make a plot
- Know how to get help

---

# What is R? 

.pull-left[
- A programming language
- Focus on statistical modeling and data analysis
    + import data, maniupulate data, run statistics, make plots
- Useful for "Data Science"
- Great visualizations
- Also useful for most anything else you'd want to tell a computer to do
- Interfaces with other languages i.e. python, C++, bash

For the history and details: [Wikipedia](https://bit.ly/1efFmaY)

- an interpreted language (run it through a command line)
- proceduaral programming with functions
- Why "R"?? Scheme (?) inspired S (invented at Bell Labs in 1976) which inspired R (**free and open source!** in 1993)

# What is Rstudio?

![](img/01_md_rstudio.png)

- R is a programming language
- Rstudio is an integrated developement environment (IDE) = an interface to use R (with perks!)

from [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/2-getting-started.html); see also [DataCamp's video discussion on the difference](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=1)

---

# Show stuff

- tour of Rstudio
- use console
- run some code
- make an R file and save it
- add some code

---

# Practice on your own

- create a folder on your computer
- set your working directory in Rstudio to that folder
- make a new script and save it as `practice.R` in your folder

(Note: later using `Projects` will make this easier)
