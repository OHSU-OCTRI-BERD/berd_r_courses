# Pre-course installation

R and Rstudio are two separate programs. You must install R first. Then Install Rstudio desktop. 

For help, try [watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOQDdJZ7Hl4&feature=youtu.be)

## Install R (first)

- Windows: Download from https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/ from the link "Download R 3.6.1 for Windows"
- Mac OS X: Download the latest .pkg file (top link, currently R-3.6.1.pkg) from https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/

## Install RStudio Desktop Open Source License (second)

- Select download file corresponding to your operating system  from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

## Open Rstudio

After installation, open Rstudio by clicking on the Rstudio icon, a round blue ball with R in it, that should look something like this:

Do not open the regular R software, it is just working in the background when you use Rstudio.

# Prepare for the course

We *highly recommend* getting acquainted with Rstudio and R prior to the workshop. You will get much more out of the workshop if you have explored the interface first.
