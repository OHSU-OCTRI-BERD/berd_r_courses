# Pre-course installation

- R and Rstudio are two separate programs. You must install R first. Then install Rstudio desktop. 
- For help, try [watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOQDdJZ7Hl4&feature=youtu.be)
- Even if you have R installed already, we highly recommend installing the latest version if it has been a while since you installed it. Just follow the instructions as below to update everything.
- **TRY TO DO THIS YOURSELF BEFORE THE WORKSHOP** If you have tried it at home and still have questions, come to the workshop 30 minutes early and the instructors will try to help.

## If you prefer to use PSU's VLAB

You can run R and Rstudio through PSU's virtual computing environment if you have PSU credentials (i.e. SPH students).

- Go to [vlab.pdx.edu](http://vlab.pdx.edu/)
- Sign in with your PSU (pdx.edu) credentials.
- Open/launch "Computer Lab"
- Sign in with your PSU (pdx.edu) credentials, again.
- Open Rstudio
- Read more about VLAB [here](https://www.pdx.edu/technology/vlab)

## Install R and Rstudio on your computer

### Install **R** (first)

- Windows: Download from https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/ from the link "Download R 4.1.2 for Windows"
- Mac OS X: Download the latest .pkg file (top link, currently R-4.1.2.pkg) from https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/
    * If you have a Mac, it's also useful to download XQuartz https://www.xquartz.org/
    
### Install **RStudio Desktop** Open Source License (second)

- Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
- Click the blue box which contains the download file corresponding to your operating system, i.e.

<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download"><img src="img/install_rstudio.png" width="40%" height="40%"></a>

## Open Rstudio

After installation, open Rstudio by clicking on the Rstudio icon, a round blue ball with R in it, that should look something like this:

Do not open the regular R software, it is just working in the background when you use Rstudio.

## Install useful packages

Download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DWG2xcwJpEasakadbxCVVs1NEbkCYIaY/view?usp=sharing) to your computer, open in Rstudio, and click "source" to run the entire document, or run each line of code. See instructions in top comments.



# Prepare for the course

## *Highly recommended*

- Get acquainted with Rstudio (and R) prior to the workshop. You will get much more out of the workshop if you have opened the software and explored the interface first.

## *Recommended*
- Try out the [Programming basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2) interactive lesson from Rstudio.
- Look over [slides from a previous version of this workshop](https://jminnier-berd-r-courses.netlify.app/01-getting-started-v2/01_getting_started_slides.html)
