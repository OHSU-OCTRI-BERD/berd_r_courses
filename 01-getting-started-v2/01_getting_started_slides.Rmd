# What is R? 

.pull-left-60[
- A programming language
- Focus on statistical modeling and data analysis
    + import data, manipulate data, run statistics, make plots
- Useful for "Data Science"
- Great visualizations
- Also useful for most anything else you'd want to tell a computer to do
- Interfaces with other languages i.e. python, C++, bash

]


.pull-right-40[
![](img/R_logo.png)
]


For the history and details: [Wikipedia](https://bit.ly/1efFmaY)

- an interpreted language (run it through a command line)
- procedural programming with functions
- Why "R"?? Scheme (?) inspired S (invented at Bell Labs in 1976) which inspired R (**free and open source!** in 1993)



---

# What is RStudio?

.pull-left[
R is a programming language]
.pull-right[
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) = an interface to use R (with perks!)

# R Projects (why .Rproj file?) & Good Practices

__Use projects to keep everything together__ ([read this](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project, for each homework assignment, etc.
- A project is associated with a directory folder
    + Keep data files there
    + Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole
    + Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there
- Only use relative paths, never absolute paths
    + relative (good): `read.csv("data/mydata.csv")`
    + absolute (bad): `read.csv("/home/yourname/Documents/stuff/mydata.csv")`
    
__Advantages of using projects__
- standardizes file paths
- keep everything together
- a whole folder can be easily shared and run on another computer
- when you open the project everything is as you left it

# Coding in the console 
 
.pull-left[
__Typing and execting code in the console __
* Type code in the console
* Press __return__ to execute the code
* Output shown below

_Coding in the console is not advisable for most situations!_
* We only recommend this for short pieces of code that you don't need to save
* We will be using scripts (`.R` files) to run and save code (in a few slides)

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
7
```

]


.pull-right[
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
3 + 5
"hello"

# this is a comment, nothing happens
# 5 - 8

# separate multiple commands with ;
3 + 5; 4 + 8
```
]

# We can do math


.pull-left[
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
10^2
3 ^ 7
6/9
9-43
```
]

--

.pull-right[
R follows the rules for order of operations and ignores spaces between numbers (or objects)

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
4^3-2* 7+9 /2
```


The equation above is computed as $$4^3 âˆ’ (2 \cdot 7) + \frac{9}{2}$$ 
]


---

# Logarithms and exponentials

.pull-left[

Logarithms: `log()` is base $e$
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
log(10)
log10(10)
```

]

--

.pull-right[
Exponentials
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
exp(1)
exp(0)
```
]

--

Check that `log()` is base $e$

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
log(exp(1))
```

---

# Using functions

* `log()` is an example of a function
* functions have "arguments"
* `?log` in console will show help for `log()`

.pull-left[
Arguments read in order:
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
mean(1:4)
```

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
seq(1,12,3)
```
]
.pull-right[
Arguments read by name:
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
mean(x = 1:4)
```

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
seq(from = 1, to = 12, by = 3)
```
]

---

# Variables

Data, information, everything is stored as a variable
.pull-left[
* Can assign a variable using either `=` or `<-`
    - Using `<-` is preferable
    - type name of variable to print
    

Assigning just one value:
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x = 5
x
x <- 5
x
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Assigning a __vector__ of values
* Consecutive integers

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
a <- 3:10
a
```

* __Concatenate__ a string of numbers

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
b <- c(5, 12, 2, 100, 8)
b
```
]


---

# We can do math with variables

.pull-left[
Math using variables with just one value
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x <- 5
x

x + 3

y <- x^2
y
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Math on vectors of values: element-wise computation
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
a <- 3:6
a

a+2; a*3

a*a
```
]


---

# Variable can include text (characters)

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
hi <- "hello"
hi

greetings <- c("Guten Tag", "Hola", hi)
greetings
```

---

# Missing values

Missing values are denoted as `NA` and are handled differently depending on the operation. There are special functions for `NA` (i.e. `is.na()`, `na.omit()`).
.pull-left[
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 5)
is.na(x)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x <- c("a", "a", NA, "b")
table(x)
table(x, useNA = "always")
```

]

# Viewing list of defined variables

 
<!-- __List of defined variables (and other objects)__ -->

* `ls()` is the R command to see what objects have been defined. 
* This list includes all defined objects (including dataframes, functions, etc.)
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
ls()
```

* You can also look at the list in the Environment window:

![](img/01_ls_screenshot.png)

---

# Removing defined variables


* The R command to delete an object is `rm()`. 

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
ls()
rm("greetings", hi)  # Can run with or without quotes
ls()
```

* Remove EVERYTHING - _Be careful!!_
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
rm(list=ls())
ls()
```
 
 * Can also remove everything using the _Clear Workspace_ option in the _Session_ menu.

# Common console errors (1/2)
 
__Incomplete commands__ 

.pull-left[
* When the console is waiting for a new command, the prompt line begins with `>`
  + If the console prompt is `+`, then a previous command is incomplete
  + You can finish typing the command in the console window
]
   
.pull-right[
Example:

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
3 + (2*6
)
```
]

```{r error=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# this is not a console example, since the console will prompt for more code with +
# 3 + (2*6
```

---

# Common console errors (2/2)


__Object is not found__

* This happens when text is entered for a non-existent variable (object)

Example:

```{r error=TRUE, prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
hello
```

* Can be due to missing quotes

```{r error=TRUE, prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
install.packages(dplyr) # need install.packages("dplyr")
```

    + *or* clicking on ![](img/01_Script_create.png) (the left most button at the top of the scripting window), and then selecting the first option `R Script` 

  
* __Type code__ in the script
    - Type each R command on its own line
    - Use `#` to convert text to comments so that text doesn't accidentally get executed as an R command

![](img/01_Scripting_practice1.png)

# Practice 1

1. Open a new R script and type code/answers for next tasks in it. Save as `Practice1.R`

1. Create a vector of all integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a1`. 

1. Create a vector of _even_ integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a2`. 

1. What is the sum of `a1` and `a2`? 

1. What does the command `sum(a1)` do?

1. What does the command `length(a1)` do?

1. Use the commands to calculate the average of the values in `a1`.

1. The formula for the first $n$ integers is $n(n+1)/2$. Compute the sum of all integers from 1 to 100 to verify that this formula holds for $n=100$. 

1. Compute the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to 100.

1. Take a break!

- Packages are to R like apps are to your phone/OS
- Packages contain additional functions and data
- Install packages with `install.packages()`
  + Also can use the "Packages" tab in Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer window
  + *Only install once (unless you want to update)*
  + Installs from [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) = package mothership

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")   # only do this ONCE, use quotes
```

- Load packages: At the top of your script include `library()` commands to load each required package *every* time you open Rstudio.
```{r}
library(dplyr)    # run this every time you open Rstudio
```

- Use a function without loading the package with `::`
```{r}
dplyr::arrange(mydata, bmi)
```

---

# Installing packages from other places (i.e. github, URLs)

- Need to have [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package installed first:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") 
```

- To install a package from github (often in development) use `install_github()` from the remotes package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# https://github.com/hadley/yrbss
remotes::install_github("hadley/yrbss")

# Load it the same way
library(yrbss)
```

# How to get help (1/2)

Use `?` in front of function name in console. Try this:

---

# How to get help (2/2)

- Use `??` (i.e `??dplyr` or `??read_csv`) for searching all documentation in installed packages (including unloaded packages)
- search [Stack Overflow #r tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
- googlequestion + rcran or + r (i.e. "make a boxplot rcran" "make a boxplot r")
- google error in quotes (i.e. `"Evaluation error: invalid type (closure) for variable '***'"`)
- search [github](https://github.com/search/advanced?q=language:R) for your function name (to see examples) or error
- [Rstudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
- [twitter #rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd)
