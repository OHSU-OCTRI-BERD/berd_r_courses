# Why Reproducibility?


- Evidence your results are correct.
- Allow others to use our methods and results.

"An article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result."

[(Claerbout and Karrenbach 1992)](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=sep:research:reproducible:seg92)

---

# Types of Reproducibility

- **Computational reproducibility:** detailed information is provided about *code, software, hardware and implementation details*.
- **Empirical reproducibility:** detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical *scientific experiments and observations [data]*. 
- **Statistical reproducibility:** detailed information is provided about the choice of *statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc*.

[R Opensci Reproducibility Guide](https://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/)

# Software tool for reproducibility: *Literate Programming*

>These tools enable writing and publishing **self-contained documents that include narrative and code used to generate both text and graphical results**.

>In the R ecosystem, knitr [R markdown] and its ancestor Sweave used with RStudio are the main tools for literate computing. Markdown or LaTeX are used for writing the narrative, with chunks of R code sprinkled throughout the narrative. IPython is a popular related system for the Python language, providing an interactive notebook for browser-based literate computing."

# R Markdown = `.Rmd` file

Code + text (in markdown syntax)

`knitr` is a package that converts `.Rmd` files containing code + markdown syntax to a plain text `.md` markdown file, and then to other formats (html, pdf, Word, etc)

# Good practices in RStudio

__Use projects__ ([read this](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project
- Sets *working directory*
- A project is associated with a directory folder
    + Keep data files there
    + Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole
    + Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there
- Only use relative paths, never absolute paths
    + relative (good): `read_csv("data/mydata.csv")`
    + absolute (bad): `read_csv("/home/yourname/Documents/stuff/mydata.csv")`
    
__Advantages of using projects__
- standardize file paths
- keep everything together
- a whole folder can be shared and run on another computer

# Reproducible Workflow

---

# Be Organized

Your files must make sense to yourself 6 months from now, and/or other collaborators.
<center><img src="img/jenny_filesalad.png" width="90%" height="50%"></center>[Jenny Bryan's "What They Forgot to Teach you About R" Rstudio::conf2018 training](https://github.com/jennybc/what-they-forgot)

---

# No! Absolute! File! Paths! (don't `setwd()`)

Absolute paths $\neq$ reproducible

Relative paths $=$ reproducible (if done correctly)

<center><img src="img/jenny_filepath.png" width="80%" height="50%"></center>

[Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/about/)'s oft quoted opinion, See post on [Project-oriented
workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

---

# Project directory structure

- .Rproj sets your working directory (**USE [PROJECTS](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)**)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Use a relative path, "relative to" the project folder
read_csv("mydata.csv") # looks in .Rproj folder
```


- .Rmd files when knit look for sourced files *in the folder they live in*

````
```{r data, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
read_csv("mydata.csv") # looks in .Rmd folder
```
````

- It's good practice to organize all your code/data/output into separate folders

These three facts together can cause a headache. Enter `here::here()`!

---

# Everything in one folder

<img src="img/report2_same_folder_input.png" width="80%" height="60%">

After knitting, this gives you (file `r emo::ji("salad")`)

<img src="img/report2_same_folder_inputandoutput.png" width="80%" height="60%">

---

# Slightly more organized

<img src="img/report3_subfolder_input.png" width="70%" height="60%">

# Dot dot: A tip about "moving up" a directory/folder

- In unix, to point to the folder one level up (it contains the folder you're in), use `..` or `../`
- As in `cd ..` moves up one directory, 
- or `cp ../myfile.txt newfile.txt` copies a file one level up into the current folder (working directory)
- In `.Rmd` when you want to source the data in the `data/` folder, you could use `..` to move up a folder into the main directory, and then back down into the `data/` folder:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# From the .Rmd folder, move up one folder then down to the data folder
mydata <- read_csv("../data/report3_nhanes_data.csv")
```

<img src="img/report3_subfolder_input.png" width="70%" height="60%">


---

# Exercises:

Within your project folder, open these files and follow the instructions:

- `report2.Rmd`
- `report3/report3.Rmd`

---

# Find the `..` confusing? Use `here::here()`!

<center><img src="img/horst_here.png" width="50%" height="50%"><a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations"><br>Allison Horst</a></center>


---

# `here::here()` $\rightarrow$ relative paths to the project directory

- The `here` package's `here()` function solves this issue of inconsistent working directories.
- The point of Rstudio project workflow is to always have the same "home" working directory = where the `.Rproj` file is.
- `here::here()` returns the project directory as a string
- Fully reproducible if the whole folder is moved or shared or posted to github
- Portable to ALL systems (Mac, PC, unix), don't worry about `/` or `\` or spaces etc

```{r}
here::here()
```

---

# `here::here()` with folders and filenames

- `here::here("folder","filename")` returns the entire file path as a string
- These file paths work when running an `.Rmd` file interactively like a notebook, when knitting it, when copying it to the console, wherever, whenever!!

```{r}
here::here("data","mydatafile.csv")
```

```{r}
here::here("data","raw-data","mydatafile.csv")
```

We will explore how and when to use this in the exercises.

---

# Exercises:

Within your project folder, open this file and follow the instructions:

- `report3-here/report3_here.Rmd`

---

# Even more organized: child documents

If you want to have separate `.Rmd` files that are sourced in one large document, you can have ["child document chunks"](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/child/):


.pull-left-40[
A file called `report_prelim.Rmd` in the `analysis/` folder

(No YAML):
````
# Details about experiment

Here are some details.
I can make a plot, too.

```{r plotstuff}`r ''`
plot(x,y)
```
````
]


.pull-right-60[
In the main doc `main_doc.Rmd`

````
---
title: "Main Report:
output: html_document
---

# Preliminary Analysis

```{r child = here("analysis","report_prelim.Rmd")}`r ''`

```

# Conclusion

```{r}`r ''`
kable(summarytable)
```

# Extensions and Tips

---

# Using other languages

- Rstudio can run [multiple programming languages](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html) in the same `.Rmd` (if they are installed), including SAS, STATA, and python.
- For more on how to use STATA and SAS, for example, see the documentation for these packages:
    + [`StataMarkdown`](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/Stataworkshops/Stata%20and%20R%20Markdown/StataMarkdown)
    + [`SASMarkdown`](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/SASworkshops/Markdown/SASmarkdown.html)

```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

---

# Other languages: Limitations

.pull-left[
- Each code chunk is run separately as a batch job when using other languages, so it's tricky to pass on objects/data to later code chunks.
- Easy way:
    + Use one language to clean data & save the cleaned data as a file
    + source the file and continue in another language.
- Other packages can be loaded that help to link objects from various languages, i.e.
    + [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html) can store objects created by python code for use in R
    + `StataMarkdown` and `SASMarkdown` use chunk option [`collectcode=TRUE`](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/Stataworkshops/Stata%20and%20R%20Markdown/StataProfile.html) to save code output.
]
.pull-right[
````
```{r setup} `r ''`
library(SASmarkdown)

```{sas analyze_data}`r ''`
/* analyze data from above code */

# Make presentation slides

- These slides were made using `.Rmd` file with the `xaringan` package!
- Simple templates can be found in `File -> new File -> R Markdown -> Presentation `

.pull-left[
- Each type of presentation uses different syntax to start a new slide
    + ```# Slide Header``` 
    + ```---```
- [ioslides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html) and [Slidy](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/slidy-presentation.html) are html slides, simple options
- [Beamer](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html) is from Latex
- [Xaringan](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) (html based on javascript remark.js) has the most flexibility for customizing slides
- [PowerPoint](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/powerpoint-presentation.html) is in the newest Rstudio release, can use custom templates

# `rmarkdown::render()`

In an `.R` file or in the console, run commands to knit the documents:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
render("report1.Rmd")

# Render in a directory
render(here::here("report3","report3.Rmd"))

# Render a single format
render("report1.Rmd", output_format = "html_document")

# Render multiple formats
render("report1.Rmd", output_format = c("html_document", "pdf_document"))

# Render to a different file name or folder
render("report1.Rmd", 
       output_format = "html_document",
       output_file = "report1_2019_07_18.html")

```

---

# `knitr::purl()` $\rightarrow$ `.R` file

Run in the console or keep in a separate R file to extract all the R code into an `.R` file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# makes an R file report1.R in same director
knitr::purl("report1.Rmd")

# Can be more specific with output
knitr::purl(here::here("report3","report3.Rmd"), # Rmd location
            out = here::here("report3","report3_code_only.R")) # R output location
```

---

# `knitr::knit_exit()`: End document early

- Exit the document early. 
- Place this in your `.Rmd` to end document there and ignore the rest.
- Run parts of the document at a time



````
```{r}`r ''`
knitr::knit_exit()
```
````

---

# Parameterized Reports

.pull-left[
````
---
title: My Report
output: html_document
params:
  data: file.csv
  printcode: TRUE
  year: 2018

---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = params$printcode
)
```

```{r}`r ''`
mydata <- read_csv(params$data)
mydata <- mydata %>% 
  filter(year==params$year)
```
````
]
.pull-right[
- Use the Knit button and you will be prompted for values
- Use `rmarkdown::render` (default values are set in YAML)
- See [chapter in R Markdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) for details
```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render(
  "myreport.Rmd",
  params = #<<
    list(data = "newfile.csv", 
         year = "2019", 
         printcode = FALSE),
  output_file = "report2019_newfile.html"
)
```

]

# Many more bonus tips

- Instead of Knit, run `xaringan::inf_mr()` in the console (or use the addin) to live-render to html as you change an `.Rmd`
- Use [git and github](https://happygitwithr.com/) for version control, and use output format [`github_document`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html) - see an [example](https://github.com/jminnier/nhanes_cvd/blob/master/report_annotated.md)
- Quickly convert `.R` files to `.html` with the [notebook/compile button](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552276-Creating-Notebooks-from-R-Scripts) or `knitr::spin()`
- Include [HTML headers or Latex preambles](https://slides.yihui.name/2019-rstudio-conf-rmarkdown-workshop.html#75) and files for definitions in YAML
- Add references and a [bibliography](https://slides.yihui.name/2019-rstudio-conf-rmarkdown-workshop.html#61) with BibTex `.bib` files
- Similar to `.Rmd` are Rstudio ["notebooks"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) -- like an `.Rmd` but all the output is saved as it is run in the notebook.
- [Look at these slides by Alison Hill](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html#1) and [these by Yihui Xie](https://slides.yihui.name/2019-rstudio-conf-rmarkdown-workshop.html) for many, many more tips and examples
