# Practice 3

1. Continue adding code chunks to your Rmd (or, start a new one! But remember to load the libraries and data at the top.)

1. How many different years are in the data? (Hint: use `tabyl()` or `n_distinct()`)

1. Count the number of penguins measured each year.

1. Calculate the median body mass by each species and sex subgroup. Use `summarize()` and `group_by()` to do this.

1. Create a 2x2 table of number of penguins measured in each year by each island.

- **Take a break!**

```{r, include = FALSE}
penguins %>% summarize(n_distinct(year))

penguins %>% count(year)

penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(median(body_mass_g))

penguins %>% tabyl(island, year)
```
