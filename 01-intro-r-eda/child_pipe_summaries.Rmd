# Working with data, we will use the pipe `%>%`

The pipe operator `%>%` is part of the tidyverse, and strings together commands to be performed sequentially

```{r}
penguins %>% head(n=3)      # prounounce %>% as "then"
```

- Always _first list the tibble_ that the commands are being applied to
- Can use __multiple pipes__ to run multiple commands in sequence
    + What does the following code do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% head(n=2) %>% summary()
```

# Numerical data summaries: `$` vs `summarize()`

We saw how to summarize a vector pulled with `$`, but there are easier ways to summarize multiple columns at once.

.pull-left-40[
```{r}
mean(penguins$body_mass_g)
median(penguins$body_mass_g)
```
]
.pull-right-60[
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean(body_mass_g), #<<
            median(body_mass_g)) #<<
```
]

---

# `summarize()` with `NA`

- Don't forget `na.rm = TRUE` if you need it.
- You can also name these columns.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g), 
            mean_len = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```


---

# By group `summarize()` (1/2)

- We can summarize data as a whole, or in groups with `group_by()`
- `group_by()` is very powerful, see [data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

```{r}
# summary of all data as a whole
penguins %>% 
  summarize(mass_mean =mean(body_mass_g), #<<
            mass_sd = sd(body_mass_g),  #<<
            mass_cv = sd(body_mass_g)/mean(body_mass_g)) #<<
```

---


# By group `summarize()` (2/2)

- We can summarize data as a whole, or in groups with `group_by()`
- `group_by()` is very powerful, see [data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

```{r}
# summary by group variable
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% #<<
  summarize(n_per_group = n(), 
            mass_mean =mean(body_mass_g),
            mass_sd = sd(body_mass_g),
            mass_cv = sd(body_mass_g)/mean(body_mass_g))
```

# Advanced `summarize(across())` (1/3)

- Can also use `across()` to summarize multiple variables ([more examples](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/))


```{r}
penguins %>% 
  summarize(across(c(body_mass_g, bill_depth_mm), mean))
```
 

```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm=TRUE))
```

---
# Advanced `summarize(across())` (2/3)

- Can also use `across()` to summarize multiple variables *and* functions ([more examples](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/))

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  summarize(across(c(body_mass_g, bill_depth_mm), 
                   c(m = mean, sd = sd))) #<<
```


---

# Advanced `summarize(across())` (3/3)

- Can also use `across()` to summarize based on true/false conditions ([more examples](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/))

.pull-left[
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(
    across(where(is.character), #<<
           n_distinct))
```

# Frequency tables: simple `count()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
penguins %>% count(island)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
penguins %>% count(species, island)
```
]

# Fancier frequency tables: `janitor` package's `tabyl` function 

.pull-left[

```{r}
# default table
penguins %>% tabyl(species)
```

```{r}
# output can be treated as tibble
penguins%>%tabyl(species)%>%select(-n)
```
]
.pull-right[

`adorn_` your table!
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(species) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>% #<<
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=2)  #<<
```

]


---

# 2x2 `tabyl`s

.pull-left-40[
```{r}
# default 2x2 table
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(species, sex) #<<
```

What adornments does the tabyl to right have?
]
.pull-right-60[
```{r}
penguins %>% tabyl(species, sex) %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "col") %>% #<<
  adorn_totals("row") %>% #<<
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% #<<
  adorn_ns() #<<
```
]

- Base R has a `table` function, but it is clunkier and the output is not a data frame. 
- See the [tabyl vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html) for more information, adorn options, & 3-way `tabyl`s

# 3 way tabyls are possible
