# What is R? 

.pull-left-60[
- A programming language
- Focus on statistical modeling and data analysis
    + import data, manipulate data, run statistics, make plots
- Useful for "Data Science"
- Great visualizations
- Also useful for most anything else you'd want to tell a computer to do
- Interfaces with other languages i.e. python, C++, bash

]


.pull-right-40[

]


For the history and details: [Wikipedia](https://bit.ly/1efFmaY)

- an interpreted language (run it through a command line)
- procedural programming with functions
- Why "R"?? Scheme (?) inspired S (invented at Bell Labs in 1976) which inspired R (**free and open source!** in 1992)

---

# Why R?
.pull-left[
- Free + Cross-platform (Mac/Windows)
- Flexible, fun, many more modern statistics methods, large community for learning and help
- One of the most popular data science tools for statistics in academia and industry
- SAS and STATA (and SPSS) are still used but becoming less popular (expensive, not as versatile/comprehensive)
- Constantly evolving and improving
- If you want a job doing stats and not be limited to specific research groups or some pharma companies, you absolutely *need to know R*
