# Practice 5

1. Continue adding code chunks to your Rmd (or, start a new one! But remember to load the libraries and data at the top.)

1. Make a scatter plot of bill depth vs bill length.

1. Add `+ geom_smooth(method="lm")` to the plot. What is this saying about the association between bill depth and length?

1. Now add `color = species` to the aesthetic `aes()`. Keep `geom_smooth`. How do the associations look now?

```{r, include = FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  labs( #<<
    title = "Flipper & bill length",
    subtitle = "Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length(mm)", 
    y = "Bill length(mm)") + 
  scale_color_viridis_d( 
    name = "Penguin species") + 
  theme_bw() #<<

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = bill_depth_mm,
           color = species)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  labs( 
    title = "Flipper & bill length",
    subtitle = "Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length(mm)", 
    y = "Bill length(mm)") + 
  scale_color_viridis_d( 
    name = "Penguin species") + 
  theme_bw() #<<
```
