# Installing and using packages

- Packages are to R like apps are to your phone/OS
- Packages contain additional functions and data
- Install packages with `install.packages()`
  + Also can use the "Packages" tab in Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer window
  + *Only install once (unless you want to update)*
  + Installs from [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) = package mothership

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")   # only do this ONCE, use quotes
```

- Load packages: At the top of your script include `library()` commands to load each required package *every* time you open Rstudio.
```{r}
library(dplyr)    # run this every time you open Rstudio
```

- Use a function without loading the package with `::`
```{r}
dplyr::arrange(mydata, bmi)
```

---

# Installing packages from other places (i.e. github, URLs)

- Need to have [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package installed first:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") 
```

- To install a package from github (often in development) use `install_github()` from the remotes package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# https://github.com/hadley/yrbss
remotes::install_github("hadley/yrbss")

# Load it the same way
library(yrbss)
```

# How to get help (1/2)

Use `?` in front of function name in console. Try this:

---

# How to get help (2/2)

- Use `??` (i.e `??dplyr` or `??read_csv`) for searching all documentation in installed packages (including unloaded packages)
- search [Stack Overflow #r tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
- googlequestion + rcran or + r (i.e. "make a boxplot rcran" "make a boxplot r")
- google error in quotes (i.e. `"Evaluation error: invalid type (closure) for variable '***'"`)
- search [github](https://github.com/search/advanced?q=language:R) for your function name (to see examples) or error
- [Rstudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
- [twitter #rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd)
