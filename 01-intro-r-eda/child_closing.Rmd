# Save data frame

* Save __.RData__ file: the standard R format, which is recommended if saving data for future use in R
```{r, eval=FALSE}
save(penguins, file = "penguins.RData")  # saving mydata within the data folder
```

You can load .RData files using the load() command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load("penguins.RData")
```
  

<br>

* Save __csv__ file: comma-separated values

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(mydata, path = "mydata.csv")
```

# How to get help (2/2)

- Use `??` (i.e `??dplyr` or `??read_csv`) for searching all documentation in installed packages (including unloaded packages)
- search [Stack Overflow #r tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
- googlequestion + rcran or + r (i.e. "make a boxplot rcran" "make a boxplot r")
- google error in quotes (i.e. `"Evaluation error: invalid type (closure) for variable '***'"`)
- search [github](https://github.com/search/advanced?q=language:R) for your function name (to see examples) or error
- [Rstudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
- [twitter #rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd)
