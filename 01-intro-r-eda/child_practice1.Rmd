# Practice 1

1. Create a new Rmd file and type the code and answers for tasks below in it. Save as `Practice1.Rmd`

1. Remove any template text you don't need (starting with line 12), and create a new code chunk.

1. Create a vector of all integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a1`. 

1. Create a vector of _even_ integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a2`. 

1. What do you get when you add `a1` to `a2`? 

1. What does the command `sum(a1)` do?

1. What does the command `length(a1)` do?

1. Use the `sum` and `length` commands to calculate the average of the values in `a1`.

1. Knit the Rmd file.

We will be using functions within the `tidyverse` package in R.

- Copy the following installation code
  + run in Rmd - only run this once, then comment it out with `#` in front
  + if you get a message about restarting R, click Yes
  + if you get an error message IN RED (warnings in orange or black text are ok), ask a TA

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
```


1. Take a break!
