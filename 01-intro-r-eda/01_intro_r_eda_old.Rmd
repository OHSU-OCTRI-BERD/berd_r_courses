# Introduction

Rrrrrr?

# What is R? 

.pull-left-60[
- A programming language
- Focus on statistical modeling and data analysis
    + import data, manipulate data, run statistics, make plots
- Useful for "Data Science"
- Great visualizations
- Also useful for most anything else you'd want to tell a computer to do
- Interfaces with other languages i.e. python, C++, bash

]


.pull-right-40[
![](img/R_logo.png)
]


For the history and details: [Wikipedia](https://bit.ly/1efFmaY)

- an interpreted language (run it through a command line)
- procedural programming with functions
- Why "R"?? Scheme (?) inspired S (invented at Bell Labs in 1976) which inspired R (**free and open source!** in 1992)

---

# Why R?
.pull-left[
- Free + Cross-platform (Mac/Windows)
- Flexible, fun, many more modern statistics methods, large community for learning and help
- One of the most popular data science tools for statistics in academia and industry
- SAS and STATA (and SPSS) are still used but becoming less popular (expensive, not as versatile/comprehensive)
- Constantly evolving and improving
- If you want a job doing stats and not be limited to specific research groups or some pharma companies, you absolutely *need to know R*

# Let's code!

## R Basics

---

# Coding in the console 
 
.pull-left[
When you first open R, the console should be empty.

<img src="img/01_console_empty.png" width="90%" height="100%">

]


.pull-right[
__Typing and executing code in the console __
* Type code in the console (blue text)
* Press __return__ to execute the code
* Output shown below in black

<img src="img/01_console_commands2.png" width="90%" height="10%">

]

---

# We can do math


.pull-left[
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
10^2
3 ^ 7
6/9
9-43
```
]

--

.pull-right[
* Rules for order of operations are followed
* Spaces between numbers and characters are ignored

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
4^3-2* 7+9 /2
```


The equation above is computed as $$4^3 âˆ’ (2 \cdot 7) + \frac{9}{2}$$ 
]


---

# Variables

Variables are used to store data, figures, model output, etc.
.pull-left[
* Can assign a variable using either `=` or `<-`
    - Using `<-` is preferable
    - type name of variable to print
    

Assign just one value:
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x = 5
x
x <- 5
x
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Assign a __vector__ of values:
* Consecutive integers using `:`

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
a <- 3:10
a
```

* __Concatenate__ a string of numbers

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
b <- c(5, 12, 2, 100, 8)
b
```
]


---

# We can do math with variables

.pull-left[
Math using variables with just one value
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x <- 5
x

x + 3

y <- x^2
y
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Math on vectors of values: __element-wise__ computation
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
a <- 3:6
a

a+2; a*3

a*a
```
]


---

# Variables can include text (characters)

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
hi <- "hello"
hi

greetings <- c("Guten Tag", "Hola", hi)
greetings
```


---

# Using functions

* `mean()` is an example of a function
* functions have "arguments" that are specified within the `()`
* `?mean` in console will show help for `mean()`

.pull-left[
Arguments specified by name:
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
mean(x = 1:4)
```

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
seq(from = 1, to = 12, by = 3)
seq(by = 3, to = 12, from = 1)
```
]
.pull-right[
Arguments not specified, but listed in order:
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
mean(1:4)
```

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
seq(1,12,3)
```

]


---

# Missing values

Missing values are denoted as `NA` and are handled differently depending on the operation. There are special functions for `NA` (i.e. `is.na()`, `na.omit()`).
.pull-left[
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 5)
is.na(x)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
x <- c("a", "a", NA, "b")
table(x)
table(x, useNA = "always")
```

]

---

# Viewing list of defined variables

 
<!-- __List of defined variables (and other objects)__ -->

* `ls()` is the R command to see what objects have been defined. 
* This list includes all defined objects (including dataframes, functions, etc.)
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
ls()
```

* You can also look at the list in the Environment window:

![](img/01_ls_screenshot.png)

---

# Removing defined variables


* The R command to delete an object is `rm()`. 

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
ls()
rm("greetings", hi)  # Can run with or without quotes
ls()
```

* Remove EVERYTHING - _Be careful!!_
```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
rm(list=ls())
ls()
```
 
 * Can also remove everything using the _Clear Workspace_ option in the _Session_ menu.

---

# Common console errors (1/2)
 
__Incomplete commands__ 

.pull-left[
* When the console is waiting for a new command, the prompt line begins with `>`
  + If the console prompt is `+`, then a previous command is incomplete
  + You can finish typing the command in the console window
]
   
.pull-right[
Example:

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
3 + (2*6
)
```
]

```{r error=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# this is not a console example, since the console will prompt for more code with +
# 3 + (2*6
```

---

# Common console errors (2/2)


__Object is not found__

* This happens when text is entered for a non-existent variable (object)

Example:

```{r error=TRUE, prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
hello
```

* Can be due to missing quotes

```{r error=TRUE, prompt = TRUE, comment = NA}
install.packages(dplyr) # need install.packages("dplyr")
```


---

# R Projects (.Rproj file) & Good Practices

__Use projects to keep everything together__ ([read this](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))
- A project keeps track of your coding environment and file structure.
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project, for each homework assignment, etc.
- A project is associated with a directory folder
    + Keep data files there
    + Keep code scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole
    + Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there
- Only use relative paths, never absolute paths
    + relative (good): `read.csv("data/mydata.csv")`
    + absolute (bad): `read.csv("/home/yourname/Documents/stuff/mydata.csv")`
    
__Advantages of using projects__
- standardizes file paths
- keep everything together
- a whole folder can be easily shared and run on another computer
- when you open the project everything is as you left it


---

# Create a new R project

<!-- *Before knitting the .Rmd file, you must first **save it**. * -->

To **knit** the .Rmd file, either
1. click on the knit icon <img src="img/knit_icon.png"> at the top of the editor window 
1. or use keyboard shortcuts
    * Mac: *Command+Shift+K* 
    * PC:  *Ctrl+Shift+K*

* A new window will open with the html output.
* You will now see both .Rmd and .html files in the folder where you saved the .Rmd file.

__Remarks:__
* The template .Rmd file that RStudio creates will knit to an html file by default
* Watch the [Reproducible Reports with R Markdown](https://github.com/jminnier/berd_r_courses) workshop for more customization and output formats (Word, pdf, slides).

# Practice 1

1. Create a new Rmd file and type the code and answers for tasks below in it. Save as `Practice1.Rmd`

1. Remove any template text you don't need (starting with line 12), and create a new code chunk.

1. Create a vector of all integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a1`. 

1. Create a vector of _even_ integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a2`. 

1. What do you get when you add `a1` to `a2`? 

1. What does the command `sum(a1)` do?

1. What does the command `length(a1)` do?

1. Use the `sum` and `length` commands to calculate the average of the values in `a1`.

1. Knit the Rmd file.

1. Take a break!

# Intro to Data

---

# How is data stored, how do we use it?

- Often, data is in an excel sheet, or a plain text file (.csv, .txt)
- .csv files open in Excel automatically, but actually are plain text
- Usually, columns are variables/measures and rows are observations (i.e. a person's measurements)

**Open the data file `yrbss.csv` and look at it**

**Move the data file `yrbss.csv` into the Rstudio project folder** 
<center><img src="img/01_filestruc.png" width="87%" height="70%"></center>

---

# Data in R/Rstudio

**Open `yrbss.csv` in Rstudio and look at it**

- Click on `yrbss.csv` in the Files pane, click *View File*
<center><img src="img/01_filestruc2.png" width="87%" height="70%"></center>

**We will show you how to store and use this data in R as a data frame**
 
---

# First, load the packages we need

We will be using functions within the `tidyverse` package in R.

- In the console, run the installation code
  + if you get a message about restarting R, click Yes
  + if you get an error message IN RED (warnings in orange or black text are ok), ask a TA

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
```

- Then add this code to the setup chunk in the Rmd and run that chunk:

.pull-left[
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```
]
.pull-right[
<center><img src="img/rmd_library.png" width="87%" height="70%"></center>
]

- Now we can use functions in these packages, such as `read_csv()` and `%>%` and `mutate()` and `tabyl()`

# Data frames (aka "tibbles" in tidyverse)

.pull-left-60[
__Vectors__ vs. __data frames__: a data frame is a collection (or array or table) of vectors

df <- tibble(
  IDs=1:3,

* Allows different columns to be of different data types (i.e. numeric vs. text)
* Both numeric and text can be stored within a column (stored together as *text*).

.pull-right[
The problem with this method, is that we need to know the column number which can change as we make changes to the data set.

- Always _first list the tibble_ that the commands are being applied to
- Can use __multiple pipes__ to run multiple commands in sequence

# `filter()` $\sim$ rows

filter data based on rows
.pull-left-40[
- math: `>`,  `<`,  `>=`,  `<=`

-  `&` (and) 
-  `|` (or)
- != (not equal)
]
.pull-right-60[

    + `!is.na(age)` 
    + `!(grade %in% c("9th","10th"))`
]


```{r}
mydata %>% filter(bmi > 20)
```


---

# `filter()` practice

What do these commands do? Try them out:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata %>% filter(age == "14 years old")
mydata %>% filter(bmi/weight_kg < 0.5)    # can do math
mydata %>% filter((bmi < 15) | (bmi > 25))
mydata %>% filter(bmi < 20, weight_kg < 60, sex == "Female") # filter on multiple variables

mydata %>% filter(id == 923122)      # note the use of == instead of just =
mydata %>% filter(sex == "Female")
mydata %>% filter(!(grade == "9th"))
mydata %>% filter(grade %in% c("10th", "11th"))

mydata %>% filter(is.na(bmi))
mydata %>% filter(!is.na(bmi))
```

---

# `select()` $\sim$ columns

- select columns (variables)
- no quotes needed around variable names
- can be used to rearrange columns
- uses special syntax that is flexible and has many options

```{r}
mydata %>% select(id, grade)
```

---

# Column selection syntax options

There are many ways to select a set of variable names (columns):

- `var1:var20`: all columns from `var1` to `var20`
- `one_of(c("a", "b", "c"))`: all columns with names in the specified character vector of names
- __Removing columns__
    + `-var1`: remove the column`var1`
    + `-(var1:var20)`: remove all columns from `var1` to `var20`
- __Select using text within column names__
    + `contains("date")`, `contains("_")`: all variable names that contain the specified string
    + `starts_with("a")` or `ends_with("last")`: all variable names that start or end with the specificed string
- __Rearranging columns__
    + use `everything()` to select all columns not already named
    + example: `select(var1, var20, everything())` moves the column `var20` to the second position

See other examples in the [data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).

# `select()` practice

Which columns are selected & in what order using these commands?  
First guess and then try them out.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata %>% select(id:sex)
mydata %>% select(one_of(c("age","weight_kg")))

mydata %>% select(-grade,-sex)
mydata %>% select(-(id:sex))

mydata %>% select(contains("race"))
mydata %>% select(starts_with("r"))
mydata %>% select(-contains("r"))

mydata %>% select(id, race4, everything())

# Save a new data frame, or overwrite existing one

Use a new variable name on left side of `<-` assignment to save updated data frames:

```{r}
mydata_new <- mydata %>% select(id:sex)
mydata_new
```

---

# `rename()` $\sim$ columns

- renames column variables
- `%>% rename(new_name = old_name)`

.pull-left[
Renames the column, just prints the output
```{r}
# This does not save the new name
mydata %>% rename(record = id)
```
]
.pull-right[

Renames the column *and* overwrites `mydata` with renamed column:

```{r}
mydata <- mydata %>% rename(record = id)
mydata

# `mutate()`

Use `mutate()` to add new columns to a tibble
* many options in how to define new column of data


```{r}
newdata <- mydata %>% 
   mutate(height_m = sqrt(weight_kg / bmi))   # use = (not <- or ==) to define new variable

newdata %>% select(bmi, weight_kg, height_m)
```


---

# `mutate()` practice

What do the following commands do?  
First guess and then try them out.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata %>% mutate(bmi_high = (bmi > 30))

mydata %>% mutate(male = (sex == "Male"))
mydata %>% mutate(male = 1 * (sex == "Male"))

mydata %>% mutate(grade_num = as.numeric(str_remove(grade, "th")))
```


---

# Practice 2

1. Create a new Rmd or continue in your current Rmd.

1. Create data frames for males and females separately.

1. Do males and females have similar BMIs? Weights? Compares means, standard deviations, range, and boxplots.

1. Plot BMI vs. weight for each gender separately. Do they have similar relationships?

1. Are males or females more likely to be bullied in the past 12 months? Calculate the percentage bullied for each gender.



---

# Save data frame

* Save __.RData__ file: the standard R format, which is recommended if saving data for future use in R
```{r, eval=FALSE}
save(mydata, file = "data/mydata.RData")  # saving mydata within the data folder
```

You can load .RData files using the load() command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load("data/mydata.RData")
```
  

<br>

* Save __csv__ file: comma-separated values

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(mydata, file = "data/mydata.csv", col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
```

# Remove rows with missing data

`drop_na()` (or `na.omit()`) removes *all* rows with *any* missing (`NA`) values in *any* column

```{r}
mydata %>% drop_na()

---

# Remove rows with duplicated data

`distinct()` removes rows that are duplicates of other rows

```{r}
data_dups <- tibble(
  name = c("Ana","Bob","Cara", "Ana"),
  race = c("Hispanic","Other", "White", "Hispanic")
)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}

# Order rows: `arrange()`

Use `arrange()` to order the rows by the values in specified columns

```{r}
mydata %>% arrange(bmi, weight_kg) %>% head(n=3)

mydata %>% arrange(desc(bmi), weight_kg) %>% head(n=3)
```

# Numerical data summaries: Using `$` vs `summarize()`

We saw how to summarize a vector pulled with `$`, but there are easier ways to summarize multiple columns at once.

```{r}
mean(mydata$bmi)
mean(mydata$weight_kg)
```
]
.pull-right-60[
```{r}
mydata %>%
  summarize(mean(bmi), mean(weight_kg)) #<<
```
]
---

# Numerical data summaries: `summarize()`

- We can summarize data as a whole, or in groups with `group_by()`
- `group_by()` is very powerful, see [data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)


.pull-left[
```{r}
# summary of all data as a whole
mydata %>% 
  summarize(bmi_mean =mean(bmi), #<<
            bmi_sd = sd(bmi),  #<<
            bmi_cv = sd(bmi)/mean(bmi)) #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
# summary by group variable
mydata %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>% #<<
  summarize(n_per_group = n(), 
            bmi_mean =mean(bmi),
            bmi_sd = sd(bmi),
            bmi_cv = sd(bmi)/mean(bmi))
```
]
---

# Combine `summarize()` with other tidy functions

```{r}
mydata %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  summarize(n_per_group = n(), 
            bmi_mean =mean(bmi),
            bmi_sd = sd(bmi)) %>%
  mutate(bmi_cv = bmi_sd/bmi_mean) %>% #<<
  filter(bmi_cv > .2)  #<<
```

---
# Advanced `summarize(across())`

- Can also use `across()` to summarize multiple variables ([more examples](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/))

.pull-left[
```{r}
mydata %>% 
  summarize(across(c(bmi, weight_kg), mean))
```
]   
.pull-right[
```{r}
mydata %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean))
```
]
```{r}
mydata %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.character), n_distinct))
```

# Frequency tables: simple `count()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
mydata %>% count(grade)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
mydata %>% count(grade, sex)
```
]

---

# Fancier frequency tables: `janitor` package's `tabyl` function 

.pull-left[

```{r}
# default table
mydata %>% tabyl(grade)
```

```{r}
# output can be treated as tibble
mydata %>% tabyl(grade) %>% select(-n)
```
]
.pull-right[

`adorn_` your table!
```{r}
mydata %>%
  tabyl(grade) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>% #<<
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=2)  #<<
```

]


---

# 2x2 `tabyl`s

.pull-left-40[
```{r}
# default 2x2 table
mydata %>% tabyl(grade, sex)
```

What adornments does the tabyl to right have?
]
.pull-right-60[
```{r}
mydata %>% tabyl(grade, sex) %>%
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "col") %>% #<<
  adorn_totals("row") %>% #<<
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% #<<
  adorn_ns() #<<
```
]

- Notice `grade` is not sorted in a pleasing way. We will learn how to deal with this when we discuss `factors` as a data type in R.
- Base R has a `table` function, but it is clunkier and the output is not a data frame. 
- See the [tabyl vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html) for more information, adorn options, & 3-way `tabyl`s

# Installing and using packages

- Packages are to R like apps are to your phone/OS
- Packages contain additional functions and data
- Install packages with `install.packages()`
  + Also can use the "Packages" tab in Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer window
  + *Only install once (unless you want to update)*
  + Installs from [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) = package mothership

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")   # only do this ONCE, use quotes
```

- Load packages: At the top of your script include `library()` commands to load each required package *every* time you open Rstudio.
```{r}
library(dplyr)    # run this every time you open Rstudio
```

- Use a function without loading the package with `::`
```{r}
dplyr::arrange(mydata, bmi)
```

---

# Installing packages from other places (i.e. github, URLs)

- Need to have [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package installed first:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") 
```

- To install a package from github (often in development) use `install_github()` from the remotes package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# https://github.com/hadley/yrbss
remotes::install_github("hadley/yrbss")

# Load it the same way
library(yrbss)
```

# How to get help (1/2)

Use `?` in front of function name in console. Try this:

![](img/01_help_screenshot.png)
---

# How to get help (2/2)

- Use `??` (i.e `??dplyr` or `??read_csv`) for searching all documentation in installed packages (including unloaded packages)
- search [Stack Overflow #r tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
- googlequestion + rcran or + r (i.e. "make a boxplot rcran" "make a boxplot r")
- google error in quotes (i.e. `"Evaluation error: invalid type (closure) for variable '***'"`)
- search [github](https://github.com/search/advanced?q=language:R) for your function name (to see examples) or error
- [Rstudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
- [twitter #rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd)
