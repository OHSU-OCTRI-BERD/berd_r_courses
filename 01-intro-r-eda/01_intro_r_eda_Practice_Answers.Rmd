# Practice 1 (pg. 1)

1. Create a new Rmd file to type the code and answers for the tasks below in it. 

1. Remove the template text starting with line 12 (keep the YAML header and setup code chunk), and save the file as `Practice1.Rmd`

1. Create a new code chunk. 

1. Create a vector of all integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a1`. 

1. What does the command `sum(a1)` do? 

1. What does the command `length(a1)` do? 

1. Use the `sum` and `length` commands to calculate the average of the values in `a1`.

1. Knit the Rmd file.

# Answers to Practice 1 questions

__#4__ Create a vector of all integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a1`. 

```{r}
a1 <- 4:10
```

__#5__ What does the command `sum(a1)` do?

```{r}
sum(a1)
```

`sum` adds up the values in the vector

---

__#6__ What does the command `length(a1)` do?

```{r}
length(a1)
```

`length` is the number of values in the vector

__#7__ Use the commands to calculate the average of the values in `a1`.

```{r}
sum(a1) / length(a1)

# this is equivalent
mean(a1)
```

# Practice 1 (pg. 2)

* Run the code below to install the `tidyverse` and `janitor` packages in R, which we will be using in upcoming slides.
  + If you get a message about restarting R, click Yes.
  + If you get an error message (warnings are ok), ask a helper.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("janitor")
```

* After running the code, comment out the code with `#` in front of the commands so that they do not run when knitting the file. 
    + *We only need to install packages once* and thus do not need to run this code again.


* __Take a break!__

```

# Practice 2

Create a new Rmd for Practice 2 or continue in your current Rmd.

1. Find the median bill length. Is the median bill length similar to the mean?

1. What is the distance between the smallest and largest bill *depths*?

1. What does the `range()` command do? Try it out on the bill depths.

1. Make a scatterplot with bill length on the x-axis and bill depth on the y-axis. What is the relationship between bill length and depth?

1. Knit your Rmd file. 

1. If you have time, 
    * install the package `skimr`
    * load the package
    * run the command `skim(penguins)`
    * what does the `skim` command do?

# Practice 2 Answers

__#1__ Find the median bill length. Is the median bill length similar to the mean?

```{r}
median(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean and median bill lengths are similar to each other. 

---

__#2__ What is the distance between the smallest and largest bill *depths*?

```{r}
max(penguins$bill_depth_mm) - min(penguins$bill_depth_mm)
```

The distance between the smallest and largest bill depths is 8.4 mm.  

*Note that we do not need to use `na.rm = TRUE` for bill depths since there are no missing values.

__#3__ What does the `range()` command do? Try it out on the bill depths.

```{r}
range(penguins$bill_depth_mm)
```

The `range()` command gives the minimum and maximum values.

---

__#4__ Make a scatterplot with bill length on the x-axis and bill depth on the y-axis. What is the relationship between bill length and depth?

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(penguins$bill_length_mm, 
     penguins$bill_depth_mm, 
   xlab = "Length", ylab = "Depth", 
   main = "Bill depth vs. length")
```

---

__#6__ If you have time, 

* install the package `skimr`
* load the package
* run the command `skim(penguins)`
* what does the `skim` command do?


.pull-left-40[
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("skimr")

skim(penguins)

The `skim()` command gives summaries of each of the variables in the dataset.

# Practice 3

1. Continue adding code chunks to your Rmd (or, start a new one! But remember to load the libraries and data at the top.)

1. How many different years are in the data? (Hint: use `tabyl()` or `n_distinct()`)

1. Count the number of penguins measured each year.

1. Calculate the median body mass by each species and sex subgroup. Use `summarize()` and `group_by()` to do this.

1. Create a 2x2 table of number of penguins measured in each year by each island.

### 2. How many different years are in the data? (Hint: use `tabyl()` or `n_distinct()`)

.pull-left[
Option 1:
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  summarize(n_distinct(year))
```
]
.pull-right[
Option 2:
```{r}
penguins %>% tabyl(year)
penguins %>% tabyl(year) %>% nrow
```
]

### 3. Count the number of penguins measured each year.

.pull-left[
Option 1:
```{r}
penguins %>% count(year)
```
]
.pull-right[
Option 2:
```{r}
penguins %>% tabyl(year)
```
]

---

### 4. Calculate the median body mass by each species and sex subgroup. Use `summarize()` and `group_by()` to do this.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(median(body_mass_g))
```

---

### 5. Create a 2x2 table of number of penguins measured in each year by each island.

```{r}

# Practice 4 (old practice 2)

1. Create a new script and save it as `Practice2.R`

1. Create data frames for males and females separately.

1. Do males and females have similar BMIs? Weights? Compares means, standard deviations, range, and boxplots.

1. Plot BMI vs. weight for each gender separately. Do they have similar relationships?

1. Are males or females more likely to be bullied in the past 12 months? Calculate the percentage bullied for each gender.

# Practice 4 Answers

__#2__ Create data frames for males and females separately.

```{r}
boys <- mydata[mydata$sex == "Male", ]
dim(boys)
girls <- mydata[mydata$sex == "Female", ]
dim(girls)
```

Check number of boys & girls:
```{r}
summary(mydata$sex)
```


---

__#3__ Do males and females have similar BMIs? Weights? Compares means, standard deviations, range, and boxplots.

.pull-left-60[
```{r}
summary(boys$bmi); sd(boys$bmi)
summary(girls$bmi); sd(girls$bmi)
```

]
.pull-right-40[

```{r fig.height=5}
boxplot(mydata$bmi ~ mydata$sex)
```
]

---


__#4__ Plot BMI vs. weight for each gender separately. Do they have similar relationships?

.pull-left[
```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
plot(boys$bmi, boys$weight)
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
plot(girls$bmi, girls$weight)
```

]



---

__#5__ Are males or females more likely to be bullied in the past 12 months? Calculate the percentage bullied for each gender.

.pull-left[
```{r}
bullied_boys <- 
  boys[boys$bullied_past_12mo == TRUE,]
nrow(bullied_boys)
bullied_boys_prct <- 
  nrow(bullied_boys) / nrow(boys) * 100
bullied_boys_prct

# alternative
mean(boys$bullied_past_12mo, na.rm=TRUE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# Apply the same method for girls:
bullied_girls <- 
  girls[girls$bullied_past_12mo == TRUE,]
nrow(bullied_girls)
bullied_girls_prct <- 
  nrow(bullied_girls) / nrow(girls) * 100
bullied_girls_prct

# alternative. Answers don't match. Why???
mean(girls$bullied_past_12mo, na.rm=TRUE)
```


]

__#5__ cont'd

On the previous slide we saw that our two methods for calculating the percentage of girls that were bullied in the past 12 months did not match. What went wrong?


```{r}
nrow(bullied_girls)
girls$bullied_past_12mo
```


To get the number of girls that were bullied we need to make sure the missing values (NA) are not included.

---

__#5__ cont'd - working with NA's

```{r}
# values of bullied_past_12mo
girls$bullied_past_12mo

# which are missing (logical)
is.na(girls$bullied_past_12mo)

# which are NOT missing (logical)
!is.na(girls$bullied_past_12mo)
```

---

__#5__ cont'd - fix girls' code

Exclude the missing values from the `bullied_girls`:

```{r}
girls2 <- girls[!is.na(girls$bullied_past_12mo),]
nrow(girls2)

bullied_girls2 <- girls2[girls2$bullied_past_12mo == TRUE,]
nrow(bullied_girls2)

# from girls dataset, total number bullied
sum(girls$bullied_past_12mo, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

__#5__ cont'd - Calculate percentage girls bullied

```{r}
bullied_girls_prct2 <- nrow(bullied_girls2) / nrow(girls2) * 100
bullied_girls_prct2

# Compare to alternative
mean(girls$bullied_past_12mo, na.rm=TRUE)
```
