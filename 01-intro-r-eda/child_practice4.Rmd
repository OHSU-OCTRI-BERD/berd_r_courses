# Practice 4

Create a new Rmd or continue in your current Rmd.

1. Create a dataset for just the Torgersen island penguins that are female.

1. Restrict the data to just Torgersen female penguins that weigh more than 3500 g.

1. Restrict the dataset from the previous step to include just the columns with the original body measurements.

1. Add a column for the difference in the flipper and bill lengths, and call it `flipper_bill_diff`.

1. How many rows and columns does your final dataset have?
